<blockquote>
<p>
This is "Mac port" addition to GNU Emacs 24. This provides a native
GUI support for Mac OS X 10.4 - 10.10. Note that Emacs 23 and later
already contain the official GUI support via the NS (Cocoa) port for
Mac OS X 10.4 and later. So if it is good enough for you, then you
don't need to try this.
</p>

<p>
This distribution of Emacs works a bit smoother than the <a href="http://emacsformacosx.com/">GNU distro</a> on
OSX. Smooth pixel resolution scrolling instead of per line. It can
display images partly in the buffer and it seems to be more responsive.
</p>

<p>
It has a customizations for assigning modifier keys to the <code>cmd</code> and
<code>alt</code> keys which by default work the other way around in the GNU
version.
</p>

<p>
See this <a href="https://github.com/railwaycat/emacs-mac-port/blob/master/README-mac">comprehensive list of features</a> as well.

<p>
The standard PHP mode package from MELPA has some quircks and does not
indent or syntax color version 5.6 of PHP like it should. This version
does.

<p>
This is a global minor mode for entering Emacs commands without
modifier keys. It's similar to Vim's separation of commands and
insertion mode.

<p>
I've bound this to <code>M-[</code> and I will try it out. I suspect I will not
really get into it, but I'll have to see.

<blockquote>
<p>
I'm sure you're aware of other-window command. While it's great for
two windows, it quickly loses it's value when there are more windows:
you need to call it many times, and since it's not easily predictable,
you have to check each time if you're in the window that you wanted.
</p>

<p>
Another approach is to use windmove-left, windmove-up etc. These are
fast and predictable. Their disadvantage is that they need 4 key
bindings. The default ones are shift+arrows, which are hard to reach.
</p>

<p>
This package aims to take the speed and predictability of windmove and
pack it into a single key binding, similar to other-window.

I discovered <code>ace-window</code> at <a href="http://oremacs.com">http://oremacs.com</a>. The blog is highly
recommended as well.

<p>
req-package is a macro wrapper on top of use-package. It’s goal is to
simplify package dependencies management, when using use-package for
your .emacs.

<p>
If you don't already use use-package or re-package you are missing
out. I use it primarily to keep my <code>init.el</code> orderly, bind keys in a
clean way and to defer yasnippet loading to keep my startup time short.

{% highlight elisp linenos %}
  (req-package yasnippet
    :config t
    :defer t
    :idle (yas-global-mode 1))

anchored-transpose.el (a newer version is in nXhtml - but it might

I always hated to swap two parts of a line which I regulary do while
programming but I did not know a better way than:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>select first part
</li>
<li>cut
</li>
<li>remember where this part <b>was</b> because the only clue will be a
missing part
</li>
<li>move to start of second part
</li>
<li>paste
</li>
<li>select second part
</li>
<li>cut
</li>
<li>move to previous location of the first part
</li>
<li>past
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The new way cuts down the number of operations:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>select region from and including the first part to the entire second
part (3 tot 8)
</li>
<li><code>C-x t</code> for the first time
</li>
<li>select region <b>between</b> the parts to I want swapped
</li>
<li><code>C-x t</code> for the second time
</li>
</ul>

{% highlight text linenos %}
aaa|bbb ccc ddd|eee
aaa bbb|ccc|ddd eee
aaa ddd ccc bbb eee
{% endhighlight %}
