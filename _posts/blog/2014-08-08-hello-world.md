I created this blog with
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) in combination with the
[So Simple Theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/) by
following the instruction on
[Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).
