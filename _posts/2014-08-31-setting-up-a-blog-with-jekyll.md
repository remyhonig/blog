Yes, you can get a blog very easily at sites like
[Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org) and
[Blogger](http://www.blogger.com). But if you are familiar with Github,
and a text editor you might be better of using a static site generator
like Jekyll.

The advantages of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) in combination with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/):

  * you can edit posts with your trusted text editor
  * use the editor commands you already got in your muscle memory
  * edit posts while offline
  * always have a local backup
  * you are not tied to a company like Wordpress or Blogger
  * you do not need to maintain or backup a database
  * no need to find hosting, let [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) do the generating and hosting for you

This blog is created with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/),
hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and uses the
[So Simple Theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/). There are some pretty high quality
themes available at
[Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/). Step-by-step instructions
can be found here: [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).

With this solution I use [Emacs](http://emacsformacosx.com/) with
[Org mode](http://orgmode.org/) to write my posts. Then I push the new
posts to my repository and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
takes care of hosting and generating the site. For finding feature
images for the posts I use
[CreativeCommons Search](http://search.creativecommons.org/).
